I work on the molecular characterization of undifferenciated gynecological malignancies
An interesting feature that these malignancies seem to share is a deficiency in the SWI-SNF complex
Here are some research papers that give a main overview of the subject:
1- SWI/SNF-deficient undifferentiated malignancies: where to draw the line: https://pathsocjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/path.5836
2- Loss of switch/sucrose non-fermenting complex protein expression is associated with dedifferentiation in endometrial carcinomas: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26743474/
3- SWI/SNF-deficiency defines highly aggressive undifferenciated endometrial carcinoma : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869930/
4- Cellular context determines DNA methylation profiles in SWI/SNF-deficient cancers of the gynecologic tract: https://pathsocjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/path.5889
